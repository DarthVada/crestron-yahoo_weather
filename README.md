# Yahoo! Weather for Crestron
### Obsolete and Nonfunctional

The [Yahoo! Weather API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) now requires authentication via API keys or OAuth. This is true for both RSS and YQL queries.

Managing API keys and dealing with query rate limits is well beyond the scope of this module, which requires no configuration beyond ZIP code.

No replacement is planned at present (2016-05-17). A replacement module may or may not use Yahoo! Weather data.

_If any user knows of an unauthenticated weather feed, please post an issue._
