# Yahoo! Weather for Crestron

The [Yahoo! Weather API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) has been updated to work with YQL.

All functions are tested to work with the latest firmware for 2-series and 3-series processors.

_Special thanks to Patrick Tisdale [ptizzy](https://github.com/ptizzy) for restoring this functionality for the community via pull request._
